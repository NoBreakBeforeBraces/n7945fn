## Questions

#### Why this project?

This is an interesting novel. I hope people saying Chinese can enjoy it.

This project is non-profit.

#### How is the project released?

See [NovelDeploy](https://github.com/tongyuantongyu/NovelDeploy)

#### Why TeX?

I reused some tools from a former translate project which uses LaTeX to generate PDF releases.
Now for this project, this feature is not implemented, but has been added into the todo list.

#### Can I post it to ***?

No if that is a for-profit website.

For non-profit sites, please don't copy content neither from the .tex files nor from any builds or releases.
I work hard on keeping hyper-text features depends on different targets, and copy simply RUINS EVERYTHING.
Instead, contact me and I'll do workaround to fully use hyper-text features available on your website and use
fallback schemes for unsupported ones.

And, in all case, as mentioned below, comply with the copyright.
